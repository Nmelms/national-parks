# National Park Project
The National Park Project is a web application that allows you to explore and learn about the national parks in the United States. It was designed and created using the National Park Service API and React, with data retrieval handled using Fetch.

When you first visit the app, you'll see three randomly selected parks as the "featured" parks. These parks will remain as featured until the end of your session. You can view live webcams and information about individual parks, including entrance fees and location.

The National Park Service API is not always up to date and may have missing images, so error handling has been implemented in this app to ensure a smooth user experience. It has also been thoroughly tested using Jest and React Testing Library.

Hope you have a great time exploring and learning about the beautiful national parks in the United States!
