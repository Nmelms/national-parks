<h1>National Park Project</h1>

<p>This is a project I designed and created using the National Park Service API. In this project I use Fetch to retreive data from the NPS API and display it using React. The API is not very up to date and has missing images and such in the response so I got a chance to use some error handling. The app displays 3 randomally selected parks as the "featured" parks when you use the app for the first time. These parks remain as featured until the end of the session. You can view active webcams as well as indiviual park info such as entrance fees and park location. This app if fully tested using Jest and React Testing Library. I had a lot of fun creating this project as the National Parks are something that interest me. I could use this app to find parks for my next trip. </p>

<h2>How to use the app</h2>
<p>You can search parks by state by selecting the explore button or take a look at one of the featured parks. You can view park information by clicking the picture of the park. You can also view live nature cams by selecting Nature Cams from the drop down menu</p>
